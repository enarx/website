**Title**: What's the big deal with Confidential Computing?   
**Authors**: Mike Bursell  
**Date**: February 8, 2023   

In this session, we will introduce attendees to Confidential Computing and how it encrypts "data in use" within a secure hardware environment called a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) by restricting access to the applications running on a host to the CPU only. Attendees will also learn how our team combines the power of open source Enarx technology with our third-party attestation service to achieve encrypted workloads using a vendor, language, and hardware-neutral platform.
