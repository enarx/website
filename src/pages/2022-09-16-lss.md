**Title**: State of Intel SGX in Linux    
**Author**: Jarkko Sakkinen  
**Date**: September 16, 2022   

We go through the current state of the Intel SGX support in the Linux kernel and userland. The topics covered include the kernel interface and its features, and available confidential computing run-times supporting SGX. Since getting into the mainline kernel late 2020, the SGX software ecosystem has started to get mature enough for production, and is the only cloud-scale confidential computing technology fully in the mainline kernel so far.
