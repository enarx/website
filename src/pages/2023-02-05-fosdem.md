**Title**: We need a Let's Encrypt movement for Confidential Computing   
**Authors**: Nick Vidal, Patrick Uiterwijk  
**Date**: February 5, 2023   

Most CISOs and a great majority of developers are not aware of the importance of encrypting data in use (the core idea behind Confidential Computing). Confidential Computing is evolving rapidly and is starting to gain adoption by CSPs, but user adoption is still slow. But what if encrypting data in use became the default way to deploy applications, both in the Cloud and even on premises? In this session, weâ€™ll discuss what are the main roadblocks towards this vision, what we can do about it, and what are the main implications if encrypting data in use becomes the norm.
