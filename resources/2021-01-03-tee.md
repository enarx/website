Today, data is often encrypted at rest in storage and in transit across the network, but not while in use in memory. Additionality, the ability to protect data and code while it is in use is limited in conventional computing infrastructure. Organizations that handle sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, or health information need to mitigate threats that target the confidentiality and integrity of either the application or the data in system memory.
