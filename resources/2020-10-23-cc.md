In classical computing, data exists in three states: in transit, at rest, and in use. Data traversing the network is “in transit,” data in storage is “at rest,” and data being processed is “in use.” In a world where we are constantly storing, consuming, and sharing sensitive data – from credit card data to medical records, from firewall configurations to our geolocation data – protecting sensitive data in all of its states is more critical than ever.
