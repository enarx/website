# Introduction

[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of various programming languages.

Enarx provides a WebAssembly runtime, based on [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/), offering developers a wide range of language choices for implementation, including Rust, C, C++, and Go.

This guide will show how to implement a [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in various languages and run it on Enarx.
