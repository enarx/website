# General instructions

## CPU Support

The following chart is the quickest way to make a good guess if a CPU is supported or not. This heuristic is **NOT** perfect. So please consult the charts below and your hardware vendor.

|                     | RegEx       | Example Supported | Example Unsupported |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| AMD EPYC            | `7..3.?`    | 7543 7443P 7373X  | 7302 7F72 7351P     |
| Intel Xeon Scalable | `[4568]3.+` | 8380 5315Y 6338T  | 5218R 4209T 6240    |

## Kernel Support

### AMD SEV-SNP

A Linux kernel with SEV-SNP support is required. As this driver is not yet available upstream, Profian can provide a kernel build for your Linux distribution.

### Intel SGX

SGX2 support is required. The good news is that SGX2 support is now available in the `6.0.0` kernel or later. If your Linux distribution does not provide this kernel version yet, there are several ways to upgrade.

#### Ubuntu

You can install a new kernel from the [Mainline Kernel repository](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v6.0/amd64/) by downloading the linux-modules and linux-image-unsigned packages, and installing them with `dpkg -i`, and rebooting.

#### CentOS / Red Hat Enterprise Linux

You can download a 6.0 or later linux kernel from [Koji, the Fedora buildsystem](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=8). Download the corresponding kernel, kernel-core, kernel-modules and other rpms, and install with `dnf install ./kernel*.rpm`, and reboot the system.

## Other Software

### Ubuntu

Follow the instructions of [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/intel-software-guard-extensions-data-center-attestation-primitives-quick-install-guide.html) to install the repository.
get an API key and install the PCCS service.
Install the DCAP quote library: `apt-get install libsgx-dcap-ql`.

For Azure, do not install the default quote provider library or PCCS service, for other environments, run `apt-get install libsgx-dcap-default-qpl`, and follow the rest of the Intel instructions to get an API key and install the PCCS service.

### CentOS / Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Download the tarball from [Intel's repository](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/dcap-latest/linux/distro/centos-stream/), extract it, and create a DNF repo file with contents:
```
[sgx]
baseurl=file://<full-path-here>
```

After this, install `sudo dnf install libsgx-dcap-ql`.

For Azure, do not install the default quote provider library or PCCS service, for other environments, run `sudo dnf module enable nodejs:16 && sudo dnf install sgx-dcap-pccs libsgx-dcap-default-qpl`, and follow the instructions at the [Intel instructions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/intel-software-guard-extensions-data-center-attestation-primitives-quick-install-guide.html) to get an API key.
After this, run `sudo /opt/intel/sgx-dcap-pccs/install.sh` to configure the PCCS service.

### Quota

Note that the quota for these instances may be 0. It may be necessary to contact Microsoft support to increase your quota.

### Attestation

Azure provides their own certificate caching infrastructure. Attempting to use the Intel Quote Provider Library (QPL) will fail.

- **DO NOT** install the Intel Quote Provider Library (`libsgx-dcap-default-qpl`).

- Instead, make sure to install the [Azure Data Center Attestation Primitives Client](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-DCAP-Client).

  1. Find the latest release on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-DCAP-Client/releases),
  2. Copy the link to the deb file corresponding to your Ubuntu release.
  3. Download the `.deb` file.
  4. Install it with `dpkg -i`.
  5. Restart the aesmd service: `systemctl restart aesmd`.

### Availability

Not all instances are available by default to all customers. For access to the above instances, you may need to contact Equinix directly.

## Google Cloud

Google does not offer SGX VMs. And while Google does have a bare-metal service through a third party partnership, the latest generation of CPUs in their offering is one generation behind. We expect this to change in the future.

## IBM Cloud

Research is currently in progress.
